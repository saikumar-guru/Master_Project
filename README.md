# Master_Project
Group 3 Masters Project Trajectory Prediction of Vehicle

# Execute the tasks one by by accordingly, Since the dataset is huge we could not be able to keep it in whole in one file.

Perform the tasks in below format and the results are saved in the diffirent files.

# Task wise execution (Task 1.ppt)

Task 1 : Prepared a presentation on datasets

# Feature Selection (2A,2B,2C,2D).py files

Task 2 : Calcuated the eculidean distances as per the feature selction and  Extracted the required features.


# a trajectory prediction model (CNN_lstm_Model, GRU_Model).py files

Bulid the models using the algorithms and Calculated the accuracy values for the models.

# Task  (prediction.py)

Calculated the ade, fde values of different models.

# Task (collision_percentage.py)

Calculated the percentage of collisions of the models pass the model according to the requirement.

# Task 6 (plot.py)

Plotted a graphs of prediction and compared with actual plot.
